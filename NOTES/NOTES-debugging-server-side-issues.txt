DEBUGGING SERVER SIDE ERRORS:

- GENERAL:

    + We use account #1 to create contracts (see truffle.js) and as the House public address.
        Therefore, since we pay for transactions server side, the private key for desired blockchain
        networks should be from that account too.  We use account #0 for testing transactions against
        the smart contract.

    + Remember, private keys should in most cases start with the "0x" prefix.  Ganache does not prepend that
        suffix when it shows you the private key for an account so you have to add it yourself.

- SYMPTOM: VM error from the EVM saying:

    "VM Exception while processing transaction: revert Ownable: caller is not the owner"

    POSSIBLE REASON: The environment variable for the private key for the account that executes transactions
        for the server has not been updated for the selected blockchain network.  This error indicates that
        the account that created the contract (see the _owner field in the smart contract), is not the
        same as the entity that is executing the blockchain call against the smart contract.
