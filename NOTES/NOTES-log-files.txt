// NOTES ON LOGGING

There are two logging systems in play.  The "default" one and Winston.  Currently we use Winston strictly for Ethereum transaction
logging.  The two relevant directories are:

DEFAULT LOGGING.

/logs/{year}/{month}/{date}.info.json
/logs/{year}/{month}/{date}.log.json

WINSTON

/logs/winston/ethtrans-{yyyy-mm-dd}.json
