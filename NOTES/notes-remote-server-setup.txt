NOTES - for setting up the remote server on Azure

- Upgrade to Node 8.11.1 and use that exact version.  10.2.1 causes "server already listening" fatal error.
- Upgrade Linux server on MSDN account with all patches
- Terminate all other unneeded processes and makes sure they are not restarted by a CRON process.
- Remove any unnecessary endpoints defined in Azure
