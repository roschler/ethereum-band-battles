This file gives a checklist for things tot ry when getting the dreaded Internal JSON-RPC error from Metamsk:

- Is a deploy necessary?  If Ganache was restarted then one is.
- Try resetting the Ganache accounts to clean up the block hash.  If you do this,
    switch away from the Ganache network and back after resetting the account via
    the Metamask menu.
