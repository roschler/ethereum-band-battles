TODO:

- It would be better to move the gas usage recording into the confirmation checks, in the part of that
    code that executes when the confirmation check succeeds.  Currently the recording operations are in the
    on-completion event handlers.  If an on-completion handler is not reached due to a fatal error in the lifecycle
    chain of STEPS after the confirmation check succeeds, the gas usage data will be lost (but only for failed
    games).
