// This file contains things to try when having problems with Metamask/Ganache, especially INTERNAL JSON-RPC errors.

Preflight Check

- DID YOU DEPLOY THE CONTRACT SINCE GANACHE HAS BEEN (RE-)STARTED?
- Is the latest contract address set in the Node.JS code? (Look at the _deployedAt data member in contract-details.js).
(REMEMBER TO RESTART THE NODE.JS SERVER AND ANY CLIENT WEB PAGES USING IT SO THAT NEW CONTRACT ADDRESS PROPAGATES TO
    THE CLIENT SIDE CODE! (i.e. - eliminating the stale contract address problem).

- Is Ganache running?
- Is it running properly?  (one time it had a blank white screen and was dead).
- Are you logged into Metamask?
- Are you logged on to the correct Ethereum network?
- Are you using the correct Metamask account when executing transactions?
- Does the Metamask account being used have a balance on the current Ethereum network?


Thing to Try

- Try resetting the account in Metamask to rule out the "stale block number" potential problem. Remember to connect
    to a different Ethereum network and then connect back to the desired one to make sure Metamask resets completely.

    Desperation level

- Turn on VERBOSE LOGS in Ganache, save & restart, reset Metamask as described above, and see if the logs show why
the Internal JSON-RPC error is happening.
