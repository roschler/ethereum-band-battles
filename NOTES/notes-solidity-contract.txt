SOME NOTES ABOUT THE SOLIDITY CODE (EtherBandBattlesManager contract)

setHouseAddress is not being called yet
Do I need to call setHouseAddress or do the equivalent for the game creator address?

NOTE: - The house address must be set and ALSO be the address that is making the call

startGame() will fail if the house address is not set on a game
addGameRoundResult will fail if the house address is not set on a game

TRUFFLE

Remember to match the "from" address for the Ganache section in truffle.js to the house public address
    in the environment variables.  Otherwise smart contract methods that use the onlyIfOwner
    modifier will fail (i.e. - msg.sender != owner).

    Environment variable: GANACHE_HOUSE_PUBLIC_ADDRESS
    Current value, Ganache deterministe: 0xBa6f5888C00Fe04D88404141343f439161374021
