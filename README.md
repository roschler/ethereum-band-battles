# Ether Band Battles

Ethereum Band Battles is a game for the Ethereum blockchain that connects music lovers directly to the bands they love.  Players compete to predict the part of a band's music video that is the favorite part of the video for *all* the players competing in a game.

At the start of a game, players contribute the amount of Ethereum the game host has set as the entry fee.  This is the "pot".  The "pot" is split into two parts, the "player pot" and the "bands pot".    The player(s) that get the most predictions correct, will be awarded that percentage of the Ethereum tokens in the "player pot".  

However, the bands will *always* get one slice of the "bands pot", a slice equal to the size of the "bands pot" divide by the number of music videos used in the game.  This is equal to the number of players in the game, since each player submits one music video from their favorite band.  This means the *bands always get paid*, while the players have the fun of winning according to their skill in predicting the most popular spot in each music video.

By playing Ether Band Battles, music fans raise *desperately needed funds* for their favorite bands, while simultaneously building awareness for them too since all the other players in the game will hear the band's music as they play the game.  It also cuts out the "middleman" from the fund raising process, so bands don't have to live in fear of getting their fan contributions reduced or eliminated entirely due to a change in policy by the video platform.
